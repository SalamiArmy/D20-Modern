Dear Reviewers,

Being that I'm completely new to GitHub and what it does, I still wasn't able to figure out how to upload a picture preview of
the whole character sheet -- even after researching it online. I'm just not familiar enough with all of the jargon yet.

The main brunt of my work was updating the Skills list and adding a Feats list. I would guess that it is certainly possible to
have the Feats list auto-calculate on top of attack rolls, etc., but that was something that my very basic understanding of HTML
found quite daunting.

I welcome any help or comments on improvements, but step-by-step instructions might be needed if I'm going to have to change
anything else. :)
